Build a very simple, functional web app frontend for a project called VeriVerse, which acts like a social media–style, agentic AI platform for misinformation detection.
Tech & Setup
Use React + Vite with TypeScript (JavaScript is fine if TS is too heavy, but keep the same file structure).
Use TailwindCSS for styling.
Minimal color palette:
Background: #F8FAFC (very light gray/blue)
Text: near-black #0F172A
Accent: a single soft blue #2563EB for buttons, highlights, status.
No gradients, no loud colors. Clean, almost “productivity app” feel.
Add .env support with VITE_API_BASE (default to "http://localhost:8000" if not set).
// src/api.ts
const API_BASE = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE || "http://localhost:8000";
Backend Integration (must match exactly)
The backend already exists (FastAPI) and exposes these endpoints:
POST /prompts
Request body:
{ "prompt": "some claim or news" }
Response:
{ "run_id": "run_123", "status": "queued" }
GET /runs/{run_id}
Response example:
{
  "run_id": "run_123",
  "status": "in_progress",  // or queued | awaiting_votes | completed
  "provisional_answer": "LLM + tools think this is likely true because…",
  "confidence": 0.78,       // between 0 and 1
  "votes": [
    { "user_id": "u1", "vote": 1, "weight": 0.7, "rationale": "local witness" },
    { "user_id": "u2", "vote": -1, "weight": 0.4, "rationale": "conflicting link" }
  ],
  "evidence": [
    { "tool_name": "google_search", "content": "snippet or URL…" },
    { "tool_name": "crawler", "content": "snippet or URL…" }
  ]
}
GET /leaderboard
Response example:
{
  "entries": [
    { "user_id": "u1", "name": "Aarav", "precision": 0.91, "attempts": 37, "points": 1200, "tier": "Diamond" },
    { "user_id": "u2", "name": "Maya", "precision": 0.84, "attempts": 21, "points": 980, "tier": "Platinum" }
  ]
}
Implement a small API helper file src/api.ts with:
createPrompt(prompt: string): Promise<{ run_id: string; status: string }>
getRun(runId: string): Promise<RunState>
getLeaderboard(): Promise<Leaderboard>
Where:
export type Vote = {
  user_id: string;
  vote: 1 | -1;
  weight: number;
  rationale: string;
};

export type Evidence = {
  tool_name: string;
  content: string;
};

export type RunState = {
  run_id: string;
  status: "queued" | "in_progress" | "awaiting_votes" | "completed";
  provisional_answer: string;
  confidence: number; // 0..1
  votes: Vote[];
  evidence: Evidence[];
};

export type LeaderboardEntry = {
  user_id: string;
  name: string;
  precision: number; // 0..1
  attempts: number;
  points: number;
  tier: string;      // "Bronze" | "Silver" | ...
};

export type Leaderboard = { entries: LeaderboardEntry[] };
If a network call fails, just throw an error and handle it by showing a very simple error banner at the top (“Backend unavailable, running in demo mode”). You do not need complex mock data for this version.
Routing & Pages
Use React Router (or a very simple router) with three routes:
/ – Landing page
/ask – Ask/Analyze page (agentic workflow demo)
/verify – Community page (leaderboard + recent run view)
1) / – Landing Page
Layout:
Very simple, centered, full-width but with max-width ~800px.
Top: Text logo “VeriVerse” (plain text, bold, small accent underline).
Main hero block:
Big headline: “Agentic AI + Community vs Misinformation”
Subtext: one sentence: “Ask a claim, let AI verify with tools, and see how the community backs it up.”
How it works (3 steps with icons in a horizontal row or vertical on mobile):
Step 1: Ask – icon 💬 – “Paste any headline or claim.”
Step 2: Verify – icon 🤖 – “Our agentic AI + tools investigate.”
Step 3: Trust – icon 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 – “Peers upvote/downvote the answer.”
CTA buttons:
Primary button: “Try the Ask Demo” → navigate to /ask
Secondary outline button: “See Community” → navigate to /verify
Below CTAs:
A simple metric strip with animated counter:
Label: “Claims Verified”
Number: start at 0 and animate up to 1,248 on mount using a light counter effect (e.g. requestAnimationFrame or setInterval over ~1.5s).
All of this on a plain, light background with minimal blue accent.
2) /ask – Ask / Agentic Flow Page
This is the main “social + agentic AI” experience.
Layout:
Two stacked sections:
Claim input card (looks like a social “compose post” box)
A card with:
Label: “Paste a claim or headline”
Multi-line textarea
Button: “Run Verification”
On click:
Call createPrompt(prompt) → get { run_id, status }
Store run_id in component state.
Immediately show a “Verifying…” status chip.
Result card (social post style)
If there is a run_id, start polling:
Every 3 seconds, call GET /runs/{run_id} via getRun(runId).
Update state with status, provisional_answer, confidence, votes, evidence.
Show:
Status pill with color:
queued → gray
in_progress → blue
awaiting_votes → amber
completed → green
Main text body: provisional_answer
A thin confidence bar under the text: width = confidence * 100%, label like “Confidence: 78%”.
A row of evidence chips:
For each evidence item, render a small pill: [tool_name] with tooltip showing the content.
A “Crowd signal” area:
Show small circular “avatars” for each vote (just initials from user_id or name if you want to join later with leaderboard).
Next to each avatar: 👍 or 👎 based on vote 1/-1.
Gray out lightly but make it feel like a comment row on social media.
If no votes yet and status is awaiting_votes, show light text: “Waiting for peer reviewers…”.
Stop polling once status === "completed".
Add a tiny timestamp (“Last updated: [time]”) using local time.
Keep this whole page visually like a Twitter/Threads single-post view: one main card, very clean, lots of whitespace.
3) /verify – Community / Leaderboard Page
This page focuses on the “social” aspect (very simple).
Layout:
Title: “Community Trust Board”
Subtext: “These are the top reviewers helping VeriVerse stay accurate.”
Call getLeaderboard() on mount; show:
A simple table or list:
Columns: Name, Expertise (you can leave it blank if backend doesn’t supply; for now just show Precision %, Attempts, Tier, Points).
Each row:
Name (e.g. Aarav)
Precision: Math.round(precision * 100) with %
Attempts
Tier (colored small badge: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond)
Points
Below the leaderboard:
Small text: “Reviewers earn points when they correctly upvote/downvote AI responses. In a full product, these points convert to rewards (goodies, coupons, perks).”
Optional but nice: add a “Back to Ask” button linking to /ask.
Components & File Structure
Use a simple structure:
src/
  main.tsx
  App.tsx
  api.ts
  routes/
    LandingPage.tsx
    AskPage.tsx
    VerifyPage.tsx
  components/
    Layout.tsx        // shared navbar + centered layout
    ClaimInputCard.tsx
    ResultCard.tsx
    LeaderboardTable.tsx
    HowItWorks.tsx    // Ask → Verify → Trust strip
    CounterMetric.tsx // 0 → 1,248 animation
Layout.tsx should have a very minimal top bar:
Left: “VeriVerse” text logo
Right: simple nav: “Ask” (/ask), “Community” (/verify)
HowItWorks.tsx: show the 3 steps with icons and short text.
CounterMetric.tsx: implement the counting animation:
On mount, use useEffect + requestAnimationFrame or setInterval to increment a local count state from 0 to 1248 over about 1–2 seconds.
Render as large number with label “Claims Verified (demo)”.
UX Rules
The entire visual style should be understated:
Plenty of whitespace, only one accent color.
Rounded cards, subtle shadows only if needed.
Avoid heavy gradients, neon colors, or busy backgrounds.
All status / feedback should be clear:
When loading: show a simple spinner or “Loading…” text inside cards.
On error from API: show a thin red bar at top: “Backend unavailable, try again later.”
Make sure the app can run by:
npm install
npm run dev
Backend expected at http://localhost:8000 unless VITE_API_BASE is set.
That’s it: keep it simple, social, and clean, wired directly to /prompts, /runs/{id}, and /leaderboard as described.
