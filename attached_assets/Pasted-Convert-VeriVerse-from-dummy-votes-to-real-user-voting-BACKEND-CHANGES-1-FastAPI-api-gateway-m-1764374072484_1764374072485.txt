Convert VeriVerse from dummy votes to real user voting:

BACKEND CHANGES:

1. FastAPI (api_gateway/main.py):
- Remove all auto-generated votes from create_prompt() - return empty votes array
- Keep status="completed", provisional_answer, evidence, but votes=[]
- Add new endpoint: POST /votes with body {run_id, user_id, vote: 1 or -1, rationale}
- Store vote, recalculate confidence, return updated run state

2. Express (server/routes.ts):
- Add POST /api/claims/:claimId/vote accepting {userId, vote: 1|-1, rationale}
- Call FastAPI POST /votes, update claim in DB, return updated claim
- Update POST /api/claims/:claimId/notes to check: user cannot add note to their own claim (userId !== claim.userId)

FRONTEND CHANGES:

3. Feed page (client/src/pages/FeedPage.tsx):
- Make each claim card clickable → navigate to /claim/:claimId
- Show vote counts but no vote buttons on cards

4. New claim detail page (client/src/pages/ClaimDetailPage.tsx):
- Route: /claim/:claimId
- Load claim data from GET /api/claims/:claimId
- Display like /ask result page: provisional_answer, confidence bar, evidence chips, votes list
- Add vote buttons (👍 Agree / 👎 Disagree) with rationale textarea - only show if user is logged in AND hasn't voted yet
- On vote submit: POST /api/claims/:claimId/vote, reload claim data
- Show community notes section - only allow adding notes if userId !== claim author AND user hasn't added note yet
- Use evidence from API response in evidence section

5. Ask page (client/src/pages/AskPage.tsx):
- After posting claim and getting result, show "View in Feed" button linking to /claim/:claimId
- Keep verification display as-is

6. API client (client/src/lib/api.ts):
- Add submitVote(claimId, userId, vote, rationale)
- Update fetchClaims to use real backend data, remove DEMO_FEED fallback
- Add getClaim(claimId) for detail page

VALIDATION:
- Users must login to vote or add notes
- Users cannot vote twice on same claim
- Users cannot add notes to own claims
- Confidence recalculates on each vote
- Feed shows real-time vote counts

Keep existing auth, minimal UI design, REST-only architecture.
