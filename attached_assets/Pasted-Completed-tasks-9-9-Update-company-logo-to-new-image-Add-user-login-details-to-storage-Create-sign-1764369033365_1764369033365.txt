Everything looks great with the login and sign-out process! You can log in with the demo credentials, and it correctly takes you to your feed page where you can see your name and claims. Signing out also works perfectly, sending you back to the login screen as it should. All the buttons, fields, and user information displayed correctly throughout the entire process.

Excellent! The login test passed. Let me update the task list and continue with the remaining tasks:

Decided on vote note storage
Now let me work on task 5 - refactoring community notes to be per-vote. First, let me understand the current structure:

Opened shared/schema.ts

Decided on vote note display
Good, I see the Vote type already has a note field. The current architecture has separate communityNotes table for per-claim notes. The task is to refactor so notes are part of votes. Let me look at how the FeedPage displays notes and votes:

Opened client/src/pages/FeedPage.tsx

Decided on per-vote notes display
Now I need to understand the task better. The current design has:

Votes with an optional note field per vote
Separate communityNotes table for per-claim notes
The refactor should make notes appear as part of votes. Let me update the FeedPage to display vote notes and update the storage/backend to support adding notes when voting:

Opened server/storage.ts

Planned vote note display adjustments
Now I understand the architecture better. The addVoteNote method exists and notes can be stored per vote. Let me update the FeedPage to display vote notes alongside votes, and update the backend routes:

Community Feed Claim Card Verification


Watch replay















The community feed page is working great! You can see the "Community Feed" title, multiple claim cards, and when you scroll, you can see all sorts of claims about things like Apple factories and RBI credit scoring. Each vote shows who voted, their domain, location, and importantly, their reasoning for the vote. It looks like the notes are now part of the vote's rationale, which is a slight change from the test plan expecting a separate message icon, but all the information is still there and easy to read.

Decided on dynamic relevancy scoring
Now let me implement dynamic user-dependent relevancy scoring. First, let me check the current implementation:

Opened server/storage.ts

Now I need to update the getAllClaims method to calculate dynamic relevancy based on the viewer's profile:

Great news! The app passed all its checks. Logging in works perfectly, letting you see your own profile with all the correct details like your name, diamond tier, location, and stats. You can also navigate around, and when you click on someone else's name on the feed, you'll see their profile page showing their unique info instead of yours. Everything seems to be working just as it should!
